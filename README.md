This repository contains my MATLAB homework demonstrating basic image processing operations:
- Grayscale conversion
- Image rotation
- Image scaling (resizing)
- Histogram equalization

## 📂 Files
- `MATLAB-Image-Transformations.m`  
  MATLAB script performing the following:
  - Converts an RGB image to grayscale
  - Rotates the grayscale image by 75 degrees (using bilinear interpolation)
  - Resizes the grayscale image by a factor of 0.25
  - Applies histogram equalization to the resized image

## ⚙️ How to Run
1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open `MATLAB-Image-Transformations.m`  in MATLAB.
3. Make sure you have the image file (`139.jpg`) in the same directory.
4. Run the script.
